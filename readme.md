## Project Description
The world of startups has seen exponential growth in recent years, with innovative ideas and technologies disrupting various industries. One crucial aspect of any startup's success is funding, and the ability to secure funding can be a make-or-break factor in the early stages of a startup's life. In this context, we analyse four datasets containing information on funding received by startups across various sectors and stages in India from 2018 and 2021. 

<b> Objective:</b> Our objective is to provide valuable insights into funding trends that can help organizations make informed decisions about their fundraising and budgeting activities. 

<b>Aim:</b> Through this analysis, we aim to shed light on the current state of startup funding and identify areas of growth and opportunity for startups and investors alike.

## Datasets Stucture (Columns):
The datasets contain the following column heading:
1. <b>Year</b> : The year of funding
2. <b>Company/Brand</b>: The name of the startup/company/brand
3. <b>Founded</b>: The year in which the company was founded
4. <b>HeadQuarter</b>: The city in which the company is headquartered
5. <b>Sector</b>: The sector to which the company belongs (e.g., AgriTech, EdTech, FinTech, etc.)
6. <b>What it does</b>: A brief description of what the company does
7. <b>Founders</b>: The names of the founders of the company
8. <b>Investor</b>: The names of the investors who provided the funding
9. <b>Amount($)</b>: The amount of funding received by the company in US dollars
10.<b>Stage</b>: The stage of funding received by the company (e.g., Pre-seed, Seed, Series A, etc.)

## Hypothesis:
- Ho: The amount of funding received by Indian startups has NOT changed over the years.
- H1: The amount of funding received by Indian startups has changed over the years.

## Questions:
1.	What are the startups that received the highest funding in each year?
2.	Who are the major investors in the Indian start-up ecosystem and what is the amount of funding provided by them?
3.	Which sectors or industries received the highest amount of funding in India from 2018 to 2021, and which sector received the highest amount of funding during this period?
4.	What is the trend in the amount of funding received by Indian startups over the years, and is there a correlation between the year of startup and the amount of funding received?
5.	How many new startups are formed yearly, and is there a difference in the amount of funding received by startups in different regions of India?
